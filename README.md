# SimulPlay
Many songs have multichannel audio stems floating around on the internet - for example: isolated vocals, lead guitar, bass, and drums. This is a helpful resource for enthusiasts who may wish to hear these tracks in unique combinations.

In one use case, guitar players may wish to hear a guitar solo by itself when learning it, and then immediately afterwards, practice the solo with a backing track. This app lets you easily do both of these things.

## Features
Select up to three audio files with the file manager by tapping the Add button (requires the Storage permission).

These files will play in sync starting from time 0:00, and individual tracks can be muted using the toggles.

## Planned additions
* Support for six tracks in total to match the number of channels in 5.1 audio
* Loading multichannel audio directly and automatically splitting it (5.1 will be split into six mono tracks)
